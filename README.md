1. why pingtester?
i live in a city where ofthen have problems with internet provider, and sometims when im working or playing games it gets laggy, to know if lag on my side (my internet) or is it from other side, i needed tool to check my internet stability. this simple tool just sends requests to one of the server from menu (or you can add your own server example: www.example.com).
2. how to use?
clone repo, open it in any IDE that supports java, and run the code in main class (pingTester/src/pingTester.java)
(img pingtester)
you will see this mini menu, then choose one of the options, after it should run and show you your latency.
3. thats it?
for now, yes. i am still working on it, will add many more features
