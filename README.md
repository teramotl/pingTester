# PingTester

## Why PingTester?

I live in a city where internet issues with the provider are common. Occasionally, when working or playing games, I experience lags. To determine whether the lag originates from my end (my internet) or the other side, I needed a tool to assess my internet stability. This simple tool sends requests to a server of your choice from the menu (or you can add your own server, for example: www.example.com).

## How to Use?

1. Clone the repository.  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teramotl/pingTester.git
3. Open it in any IDE that supports Java.
4. Run the code in the main class (`pingTester/src/pingTester.java`).

5. You will see this mini menu. Choose one of the options, and it should run, displaying your latency.

## Is That It?

For now, yes. I am still actively working on it and will be adding many more features.
