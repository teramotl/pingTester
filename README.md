# PingTester

## Why PingTester?

I live in a city where internet issues are common. Occasionally, when working or playing games, I experience lags. To determine whether the lag originates from my end (my internet) or the other side, I needed a tool to assess my internet stability. This simple tool sends requests to a server of your choice from the menu (or you can add your own server, for example: www.example.com).

## How to Use?

1. Clone the repository.  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teramotl/PingTester.git
   cd PingTester
3. Run exe file.
4. Choose first option and enter any domain or ip to check your ping. (Better to use stable website to check like www.google.com)

## That's It?

For now, yes.
